#### More description of interviewees(fictional):

| **Name**      | **Description**                                     |

Although the interviewee information and responses are all fictional, the age of all recruited interviewees should be a normal distribution. To calculate the normal distribution, we should use this formula: 
>The probability density function of a normal distribution is given by $( f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2}} )$, where $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.To calculate the mean of a probability distribution:

$$
\mu = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i
$$
